1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [SmithHW8]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        Node.h
        BSTree.cpp
        makefile
        Readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [SmithHW8] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./[hw8]

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
